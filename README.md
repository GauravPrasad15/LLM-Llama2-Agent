# LLM-Llama2-Agent
This is a LLM project where I am using a open source model "llama2" which runs on my local system. Using llama2 I'll be creating an conversational Agent which contains tools as Wikipedia, Arxiv and an user defined site. It uses these tools to converse with an user and answer his/her questions.
